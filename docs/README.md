# Documentation Structure

## Organization

Documentation in Kodigo ng Kawalan is organized by technology/tool:

```
docs/
├── README.md (this file)
├── n8n/
│   └── WEBHOOK.md - Understanding Meta integration through n8n
```

## What Goes Where

**`/n8n`** - n8n workflow automation platform
- Webhook configuration and Meta integration
- Workflow setup guides
- Layer-by-layer philosophy for understanding automation

**Add more folders as needed:**
- `/docker` - Container and deployment docs
- `/ai` - AI model integration guides
- `/security` - Security configurations
- `/deployment` - Deployment strategies

## Philosophy

Each guide here follows the manifesto:
- **Understanding layers** - Not just copy-paste
- **Raw and unfiltered** - No corporate fluff
- **Practical + philosophical** - Technical excellence + understanding

---

**Start here**: If you're setting up Meta webhooks with n8n, read `n8n/WEBHOOK.md`
